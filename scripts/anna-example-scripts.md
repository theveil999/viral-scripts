**Parasocial Levers:** fantasy_invitation, direct_address, sexual_tension  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

> So like, if you're the type of guy who will grab me by the back of my neck, look me dead in the eyes, and whisper "good girl" after I've been bratty? You fucked up, okay? Because now I'm never letting you go. Like, marry me right now, you lug nut. Am I asking for too much here?

## SCRIPT 2: Brand Anchor (Taco Bell) + Sexual Tension
**Hook Type:** confession  
**Parasocial Levers:** confession, sexual_tension, playful_self_deprecation  
**Duration:** ~18 seconds

> My toxic trait is that I have this fantasy where like, we're at Taco Bell at 2am after we've been going at it all night, and while I'm eating my Doritos Locos Tacos, you just like, reach over and start something under the table. And I'm sitting there trying to keep a straight face while ordering more Baja Blast. Like, is that so weird? Good soup.

**Why it works:**

**Why it works:**
- Uses her actual bedroom dynamic (submissive/dominant flip)

Like what the fuck are you doing? You knew I had one before! The dating scene is absolutely disgusting, I swear to god.

**Why it works:**
- Based on her actual story from branding call

## WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE ORIGINAL GENERATED SCRIPTS

### Original Script 1 (Carnegie Hall):
❌ Self-focused - talks about HER being impressive  
❌ Puts men DOWN instead of making them feel chosen  
❌ "lug nut" forced into wrong context  
❌ No sexual content  
❌ Would make male viewers feel inadequate  

### Original Script 2 (Music During Sex):
❌ Way too vague - "good music" isn't specific  
❌ No visual imagery  
❌ Doesn't use any of her unique traits  
❌ Generic - any creator could say this  
❌ "am I weird" - seeking validation vs confident  

### Original Script 3 (Song/Babies):
❌ Random topic that doesn't convert  
❌ No sexual content  
❌ Not speaking TO male viewers  
❌ Screaming in car = not relevant to OF conversion  
❌ No CTA

3. **Add brand_anchors** (Taco Bell is GOLD)
4. **Add her actual sexual vocabulary**
5. **Update parasocial_config.strengths** with challenge, fantasy_invitation
6. **Use her sample_speech** verbatim quotes as reference
